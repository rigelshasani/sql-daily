# Pandas Exercises 81-90: Advanced Weakness-Focused Challenges

## Exercise 81: Multi-Index Operations & Memory Optimization
```
Create a multi-index DataFrame with dept/hire_year levels from employees data.
Calculate rolling 3-period salary averages within each department without flattening the index.
Optimize memory usage by converting appropriate columns to categorical dtype.
Compare memory usage before and after optimization.

## Exercise 82: Complex String Operations & Regex
```
Extract department codes from employee email addresses using the first 2-3 letters of the dept name.
Clean and standardize phone numbers into format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX
Handle missing data and malformed entries gracefully.
Compare performance of vectorized .str operations vs .apply() with custom functions.
```

```

## Exercise 83: Advanced Pivot Tables with Calculations
```
Create a pivot table showing:
- Rows: department
- Columns: hire_year  
- Values: average salary
Add row/column totals and calculate each cell as % of grand total.
Include a second pivot showing salary standard deviation by the same dimensions.
```

## Exercise 84: Performance Benchmarking & Query Optimization
```
Create 3 different approaches to find employees earning above their department's 75th percentile:
1. Using .transform() and .quantile()
2. Using merge with grouped quantile calculations
3. Using .query() with a more complex expression
Benchmark execution time for each approach and explain the performance differences.

## Exercise 85: Advanced Datetime Manipulations
```
Calculate business days worked by each employee (excluding weekends).
Create tenure brackets in business quarters (0-4 quarters, 4-8 quarters, etc.).
Find employees who started on the same day of week and analyze their average tenure.
Handle timezone-aware datetime operations if hire_date had timezone info.
```

```python
# Your solution here
```

## Exercise 86: Custom Aggregation Functions & Apply Performance
```
Write custom aggregation functions to calculate:
- Salary Gini coefficient within each department
- Interquartile range (IQR) for each department
- Custom "promotion readiness" score based on tenure and performance ranking
Apply these efficiently using .agg() with lambda functions vs named functions.
```

```python
# Your solution here
```

## Exercise 87: Advanced Merging Strategies & Validation
```
Perform a complex many-to-many merge simulation:
- Create a skills table where employees can have multiple skills
- Create a projects table where projects require multiple skills
- Find all employee-project matches based on skill overlap
- Validate merge results and handle duplicate/missing combinations
Include merge indicator analysis and relationship cardinality checks.
```

```

## Exercise 88: Memory-Efficient Large Dataset Simulation
```
Simulate working with a large dataset by:
- Creating a 100K+ row employee dataset with realistic distributions
- Implement chunked processing for salary calculations
- Use .pipe() method for chained operations
- Demonstrate when to use .copy() vs views for memory efficiency
Compare memory usage across different processing strategies.
```

```python
# Your solution here
```

## Exercise 89: Advanced Window Functions & Complex Rankings
```
Implement complex ranking scenarios:
- Dense rank within department but with ties broken by hire_date
- Calculate nth highest salary per department (where n varies by department size)
- Running maximum salary seen up to each employee's hire date
- Percentile rank calculation with custom interpolation methods
```

```python
# Your solution here
```

## Exercise 90: Production-Ready Data Pipeline Simulation
```
Build a complete data processing pipeline that:
- Validates input data quality (null checks, range validation, referential integrity)
- Applies business rules with comprehensive error handling
- Generates summary statistics and data quality reports
- Implements logging for debugging and monitoring
- Creates unit tests for critical functions
Structure as reusable functions with proper documentation.
```
