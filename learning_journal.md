## Latest Session
**Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Focus:** A/B Testing fundamentals + Business visualization  
**Breakthrough:** Business charts should drive decisions, not just show data - visual hierarchy tells the story instantly (green=good, gold=great, red=problem)  
**Frustration:** Matplotlib syntax complexity - too many overlapping concepts at once (bars, legends, patches, hatching)  
**Next Focus:** Apply visualization skills to real projects, or continue with churn analysis concepts

## How I Learn Best
- Need concept intro before domain work
- Breakthroughs after 2-3 contexts of same pattern  
- Learn by failing and fixing, not receiving solutions
- Must understand business context first
- When tired, technical details become overwhelming

## Recent Breakthroughs
- **Sep 03:** Business visualization = visual storytelling, not data display; A/B testing as conversion rate comparison + consistency checking
- **Aug 27:** Data cleaning as strategic business decisions, not technical fixes
- **Aug 26:** Professional data skepticism - assess scope before fixing  
- **Aug 25:** CTEs as "temporary named subqueries"
- **Aug 24:** Department-level vs employee-level calculations

## Teaching Notes
- High energy = good for complex workflows
- When frustrated, step back to fundamentals
- Need to understand "why" behind fixes
