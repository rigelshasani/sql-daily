## Latest Session
**Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Focus:** A/B Testing fundamentals  
**Breakthrough:** A/B testing clicked as conversion rate comparison + consistency checking, not just raw numbers  
**Frustration:** Sample size intuition still fuzzy - why bigger samples = more confidence  
**Next Focus:** Statistical significance calculations, hypothesis formulation

## How I Learn Best
- Need concept intro before domain work
- Breakthroughs after 2-3 contexts of same pattern  
- Learn by failing and fixing, not receiving solutions
- Must understand business context first

## Recent Breakthroughs
- **Sep 03:** A/B testing as fair comparison (conversion rates) + consistency over time
- **Aug 27:** Data cleaning as strategic business decisions, not technical fixes
- **Aug 26:** Professional data skepticism - assess scope before fixing  
- **Aug 25:** CTEs as "temporary named subqueries"
- **Aug 24:** Department-level vs employee-level calculations

## Teaching Notes
- High energy = good for complex workflows
- When frustrated, step back to fundamentals
- Need to understand "why" behind fixes
