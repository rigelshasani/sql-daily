**Session #:** 75

## Recent Session Reflection

**Breakthrough:** Data cleaning clicked as strategic business decisions, not just technical fixes. Creating `is_login_date_missing` boolean preserved customer records while flagging missing data as potential signal.

**Frustration:** None - business context introduction protocol worked well.

**Confidence:** Medium-High  
**Energy:** High

## Key Learning Insights (Persistent)

**How I Learn Best:**
- Need concept introduction before domain-specific work
- Breakthroughs happen after 2-3 different contexts of same pattern  
- Function best with "fail and fix" rather than receiving solutions
- Must understand business context before technical implementation

**Teaching Calibration:**
- High energy = good time for complex, multi-step workflows
- When frustrated, step back to fundamentals rather than push through
- Respond well to systematic approaches and frameworks
- Need to understand "why" behind fixes, not just "what" to type

## Recent Breakthroughs (Last 5)
