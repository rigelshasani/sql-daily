## Latest Session
**Date:** 2025-09-05
**Focus:** A/B Testing complete workflow + Statistical significance testing
**Breakthrough:** Understanding that you need BOTH business significance AND statistical significance for confident decisions - a 9.4% improvement means nothing if it could be random chance (z-test mechanics mastered)
**Challenge:** Building intuition for when sample sizes make differences meaningful vs when they're just noise
**Next Focus:** Churn analysis concepts OR advanced statistical testing (power analysis, multiple testing corrections)

## How I Learn Best
- Need concept intro before domain work
- Breakthroughs after 2-3 contexts of same pattern
- Learn by failing and fixing, not receiving solutions
- Must understand business context first
- When tired, technical details become overwhelming
- **NEW:** Statistical concepts need step-by-step building - can't jump to complex formulas

## Recent Breakthroughs
- **Sep 05:** A/B testing = randomization verification + conversion analysis + statistical significance; z-test measures "how many standard errors away from expected"; pooled rates under null hypothesis
- **Sep 03:** Business visualization = visual storytelling, not data display; A/B testing as conversion rate comparison + consistency checking
- **Aug 27:** Data cleaning as strategic business decisions, not technical fixes
- **Aug 26:** Professional data skepticism - assess scope before fixing
- **Aug 25:** CTEs as "temporary named subqueries"
- **Aug 24:** Department-level vs employee-level calculations

## Teaching Notes
- High energy = good for complex workflows
- When frustrated, step back to fundamentals
- Need to understand "why" behind fixes
- **NEW:** Statistical testing requires building conceptual foundation before calculation mechanics
