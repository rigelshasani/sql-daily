## Current Mistakes & Misconceptions to Fix
| Issue | Context | Last Seen | Status |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Matplotlib legend timing | Business_Visualization | 2025-09-03 | fixed |

## Active Learning Patterns
| Pattern | Project | Attempts | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Churn_Analysis_Concepts | Churn_Analysis | 0 | new concept |
| AB_Test_Design | AB_Test_Project | 2 | **MASTERED** - Full workflow with statistical foundation |
| Statistical_Significance_Testing | AB_Test_Project | 1 | Z-test mechanics conquered |
| Business_Context_Visualization | Viz_Chart_Project | 0 | conquered |

## Key Learning Rules
- You need concept intro before domain exercises
- Breakthroughs after 2-3 contexts of same pattern
- Must state population before filtering (avoid denominator drift)
- Learn by failing and fixing, not receiving solutions
- **NEW:** Both business significance AND statistical significance required for confident decisions

## Recent Context
- **Completed:** SQL drills 151-170 (CTEs), Pandas churn analysis, memory profiling, **A/B testing complete workflow**
- **Mastered:** Randomization verification, conversion rate analysis, z-test for proportions, null hypothesis testing
- **Active Projects:** Churn analysis concepts (ready to start)
- **Focus Areas:** Statistical testing applications, data quality assessment in experimental contexts
