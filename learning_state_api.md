## Recent Completions
- **Aug 2025:** SQL drills 151-155 (CTEs, window functions)  
- **Aug 2025:** Pandas exercises 1-60 complete (skipped 47, 49)
- **Aug 2025:** Memory profiling drill (43% memory savings)
- **Aug 2025:** Updated churn analysis scaffolding (commit `441a074`, 2025-08-26 16:15)  

## Learning Patterns
- Needs concept introduction before domain-specific exercises
- Breakthroughs come after 2-3 contexts of same pattern  
- Must state population before filtering to avoid denominator drift
- Kinesthetic learner - needs to fail and fix rather than receive solutions

## Schema Rules
- **Fails:** Cumulative FAIL attempts on a pattern. Never reset - preserves learning history.
- **Status transitions:** 
  - **learning → struggling:** When fails reach 2+
  - **struggling → conquered:** After consistent passes across multiple contexts (no recent fails)
  - **conquered → under_review:** Automatically after 7-14 days to test retention
- **Review scheduling:**
  - **conquered patterns:** Schedule review 7-14 days after mastery
  - **struggling patterns:** Schedule reinforcement review 3-7 days after multiple fails
- **Project column:** Links patterns to current deliverables for context-aware session planning
