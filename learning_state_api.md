## Current Mistakes & Misconceptions to Fix
| Issue | Context | Last Seen | Status |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Matplotlib legend timing | Business_Visualization | 2025-09-03 | fixed |

## Active Learning Patterns
| Pattern | Project | Attempts | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Churn_Analysis_Concepts | Churn_Analysis | 0 | new concept |
| AB_Test_Design | AB_Test_Project | 0 | conquered |
| Business_Context_Visualization | Viz_Chart_Project | 0 | conquered |

## Key Learning Rules
- You need concept intro before domain exercises
- Breakthroughs after 2-3 contexts of same pattern  
- Must state population before filtering (avoid denominator drift)
- Learn by failing and fixing, not receiving solutions

## Recent Context
- **Completed:** SQL drills 151-170 (CTEs), Pandas churn analysis, memory profiling
- **Active Projects:** A/B test scaffold, business-context visualizations
- **Focus Areas:** Data cleaning workflows, churn business logic, A/B test design
