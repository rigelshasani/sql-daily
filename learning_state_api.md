## Key Learning Rules & Patterns

**Technical Learning:**
- Need concept intro before domain exercises
- Breakthroughs after 2-3 contexts of same pattern  
- Must state population before filtering (avoid denominator drift)
- Learn by failing and fixing, not receiving solutions

**Statistical Learning:**
- **Both business significance AND statistical significance required for confident decisions**
- Statistical concepts need step-by-step building - can't jump to complex formulas
- Sample size affects whether differences are meaningful vs noise

**Code Quality:**
- Always use `.copy()` when modifying DataFrames
- Filter nulls early before aggregations
- Specify merge suffixes for clarity
- Use `.transform()` for row-level stats, `.agg()` for summaries

## Recent Breakthroughs & Learning Sessions

### Latest Session (2025-09-05)
**Focus:** A/B Testing complete workflow + Statistical significance testing  
**Breakthrough:** Understanding that you need BOTH business significance AND statistical significance for confident decisions - a 9.4% improvement means nothing if it could be random chance (z-test mechanics mastered)  
**Challenge:** Building intuition for when sample sizes make differences meaningful vs when they're just noise

### Previous Key Breakthroughs
- **Sep 03:** Business visualization = visual storytelling, not data display
- **Aug 27:** Data cleaning as strategic business decisions, not technical fixes  
- **Aug 26:** Professional data skepticism - assess scope before fixing
- **Aug 25:** CTEs as "temporary named subqueries"
- **Aug 24:** Department-level vs employee-level calculations

## How You Learn Best

**Optimal Conditions:**
- High energy = good for complex workflows
- Need to understand business context first
- Statistical concepts require conceptual foundation before calculation mechanics

**Challenge Areas:**
- When tired, technical details become overwhelming
- When frustrated, need to step back to fundamentals  
- Need to understand "why" behind fixes, not just "how"
